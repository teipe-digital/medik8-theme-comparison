It is an active ingredient that is able to help block the processes within the skin which form uneven tone and dark spots. Think visibly brighter, more clarified skin with a more even tone.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>What does Tranexamic Acid do?<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTranexamic acid is a pigment-suppressor, meaning it can block the overproduction of melanin within the skin. When melanin is overproduced in certain areas of the skin, it can result in uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation and dark spots.<\/p>","cta_text":"SHOP NOW","cta_link":"https:\/\/de.medik8.com\/products\/press-clear"}},"1662546349fabeb5c4":{"type":"MOS2-content-feature","settings":{"image_alignment":"right","content_alignment":"center","heading":"How does Tranexamic Acid work?","paragraph":"Tranexamic acid provides powerful brightening action, by helping to prevent the formation of dark spots on the skin.\n<p>\nIt works by reducing the activity of an enzyme called ‘tyrosinase’, the main enzyme responsible for creating melanin, while blocking the transfer of melanin to upper layers of the skin, where it becomes visible as hyperpigmentation on the complexion. \n<\/p><p>\nTyrosinase can go into overdrive when faced with sun exposure, overproducing melanin which can result in uneven patches of tone and dark spots. Combined with wearing sunscreen everyday, tranexamic acid can help to reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation and visibly brighten targeted areas of the skin.\nTranexamic acid also has a secondary benefit of providing a powerful and specific anti-inflammatory action. It reduces inflammation in the skin by inhibiting the release of proinflammatory signalling molecules. This is particularly useful in preventing post-inflammatory erythema, a.k.a. the pink or red marks that are left on your skin post-breakout or injury.<\/p>","cta_text":"","cta_link":""}},"1662546759ea88c72f":{"type":"MOS2-content-feature","settings":{"image_alignment":"left","content_alignment":"center","heading":"What skin concerns can Tranexamic Acid help to address?","paragraph":"Tranexamic acid is a hyperpigmentation hero - it is perfect for those looking to improve the evenness of skin tone, visibly fade stubborn dark spots, clarify the look of skin post-blemish and for overall radiance.
