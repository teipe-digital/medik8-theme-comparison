Practical training takes place annually (pandemics aside) at our extremely popular “Train The Trainer” event in London, UK. This event combines a mixture of theoretical and practical education to provide Education Managers with the latest information and techniques so they can return to their respective countries and educate their network of salons, spas, clinics and doctors with our Medik8 protocols. For more proficient trainers, we offer a series of London-based “Masterclasses” covering more detailed technologies.<\/p>\n\n<p>Training and education are the heartbeat of Medik8. Our experienced team of international trainers and R&D specialists travel the world to deliver high-level education to thousands of business owners, distributors, trainers and therapists every year. We take a truly tailored approach to ensure the type and level of education delivered matches that of the audience: from therapists right through to dermatologists and doctors. Initial training is given followed by a programme of continuous learning “refreshers” to ensure trainers are following the latest techniques.<\/p>","block_cta_link_3":"","block_cta_text_3":"","block_heading_4":"What do I have to do?","block_paragraph_4":"<p>Find a local distributor in your country.
